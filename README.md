# Node collections library

This is a collections library originally written in 1998-99 to provide a simple,
serializable collection format to aid in parsing binary files in C/C++.

There is no connection to the node.js project; the name is a coincidence.

# Usage

From C/C++ link to the node.lib static library.  Node is not distributed as a dynamic library.
