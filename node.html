    <h1>Node Library Documentation</h1>

	<h2> Overview </h2>
	<p>
	The node library was originally designed to support reverse-engineering the
	Conductor NT file format.  It has turned into a general-purpose lightweight 
	collection class with a text-based persistence format.

	<h2> Upgrading From Previous Release </h2>
	<p>
	The new Release-build node.dll is binary-compatible with programs built against the old 
	node library.  This means that you can install a new Release-build node.dll in your Overrides 
	directory and old versions of programs that use node.dll will still run.  If that is not true,
	please let us know which programs it is broken for!
	<p>
	The new library is not source-compatible with all previous code.  To get your program
	running with the new library, use the following guide.

	<h3> Install and Build New Node Source Code </h3>
	<p>
	As of this writing (August 4, 2006) the new node source code is checked in on the 
	work branch in CVS.  Check out the node module with <tt>-r work</tt> into a node-work
	directory parallel to your node directory.
	<p>
	To build the unit tests (recommended) you will need to configure the PYTHON environment 
	variable to point where python is installed on your computer.  (You could also use Perl if 
	you happen to have perl installed.  Most developer machines have python installed to make WinCVS 
	work better.  If Python is not installed, get it from <a href="http://www.activestate.org/ASPN/Python">http://www.activestate.org/ASPN/Python</a>.)
	<p>
	To configure environment variables, either use the System control panel (Control Panels | System | 
	Advanced | Environment Variables | System Variables) or edit the registry under
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment]
	and create a key named PYTHON.  The typical value will be "C:\Program Files\Python24\python.exe". Below is
	a .reg file which will create the appropriate key for you:<br />
<pre>
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment]
"PYTHON"="C:\\Program Files\\Python24\\python.exe"
</pre>
    <p>
	You will also need to check out the unit test framework.  It is in CVS with the module name 'cxxtest'.
	Node expects it to be checked out into the directory <tt>..\cxxtest</tt>; if you check it out
	somewhere else, you will need to edit <tt>node-work/Makefile</tt> to reflect the location of cxxtest.
	<p>
	Now you can open node-work\node.dsw in Visual Studio.  If you have an existing instance of
	Visual Studio, you must close and restart it to pick up the new environment variable.
	Do a Build | Batch Build and select -
	<ul>
	 <li> All of the CxxTest_1_Run projects
	 <li> node - Win32 Release
	 <li> node - Win32 Debug
	</ul>
	Then click "Build".  The node projects will build and (if you have set up Python or Perl), the tests
	will run.  The tests application with throw up a big progress bar which should remain all-green.
	<p>
	Now you have a complete build of the work version of node.
	
	<h3> Update Your Projects to use the new Node </h3>
	<p>
	Hyperlink-work is already updated at this writing. Other work applications might 
	be already updated, so do a CVS update before continuing. You only need to follow 
	these steps if you don't have updated work version.
	<p>
	First, edit the Project files and change all the instances of <tt>..\node</tt>, <tt>..\..\node</tt>, etc. to
	<tt>..\node-work</tt>, <tt>..\..\node-work</tt>, etc.  These are in C/C++ | Preprocessor | Additional include directories
	and in Link | Input | Additional Library Path or as part of the path to node.lib in Link | Input | Object/library modules.
	<p>
	The name of the debug node library is now noded.dll.  This is so you can install the
	debug node library in Overrides without screwing up all the Release-build programs that rely
	on the Release library.  You will need to change the name of the library (for your Debug builds <b>only</b>)
	in the Link | Input | Object/library modules
	from node.lib to noded.lib.
	<p>
	The node structure <tt>struct __node</tt> is no longer exposed in the node.h header.  Direct reference to 
	structure members is no longer allowed -- e.g., you used to be able to do <tt>pn->nHashElements</tt> and now
	you must do <tt>node_get_elements( pn )</tt>.  These will come in as compile errors.  In brief, you should change:
	<ul>
	  <li> <tt> pn->pnListElements </tt> to <tt> node_get_elements( pn ) </tt>
	  <li> <tt> pn->pnHashElements </tt> to <tt> node_get_elements( pn ) </tt>
	  <li> <tt> pn->nType </tt> to <tt> node_get_type( pn ) </tt>
	</ul>
	References to other members (e.g., pnListTail) are uncommon.  Usually if they occur, they can be handled
	by using new API features.
	<p>
	Now install the tagged noded.dll in your project's Debug directory and the node.dll in the Overrides directory.
	Your project should build and run normally, both in the debugger and out.

	<h2> Old Features of Node </h2>

	<h2> New Features in this Release (2.1) </h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li> <a href="#Unit_Tests">Unit Tests</a>
		<li> <a href="#NODE_REF">Add-reference semantics for lists and hashes</a>
		<li> <a href="#debug">Debugging Features</a>
		<li> <a href="#performance">Various non-user-visible performance changes</a>
		<li> <a href="#NODE_PTR">New node type for safely storing pointers</a>
	</ul>

	<h3> <a name="Unit_Tests">Unit Tests</a> </h3>
	<p>
	This is the big green bar thing.  Currently the tests assure all of the basic functionality and
	aim to ensure safety of node operations.  They do not yet cover all exceptional conditions, assertions, etc.
	<p>
	Unit tests are implemented in CxxTest, with documentation in the CxxTest directory you checked out in order
	to build node.  The tests are in <tt>test\BasicNodes.h</tt>

	<h3> <a name="NODE_REF">Add-reference semantics for lists and hashes</a> </h3>
	<p>
	In previous versions of node, the only way to store nodes within nodes was by copying.  The typical metaphor
	for generating a large data structure was:
	<pre>
	pnBody = node_hash_alloc();
	pnRecords = node_list_alloc();

	for( /* all records */ )
	{
		node_t * pnRecord = parse_record();
		node_list_add( pnRecords, NODE_NODE, pnRecord );
		node_free( pnRecord );
	}

	node_hash_add( pnBody, "Records", NODE_NODE, pnRecords );
	node_free( pnRecords );</pre>
	<p>
	There is an implicit copy when adding a node to a collection: node_list_add(), node_hash_add() and node_push() 
	all use the NODE_NODE type to indicate that a copy of the node argument should be added to the collection.
	<p>
	Unfortunately node_copy() is very slow, especially when the node to copied contains many other possibly complex
	nodes (such as the <tt>pnRecords</tt> node in the above example).  And note that we store a copy of the node 
	in the collection and then immediately free the original.  How wasteful!
	<p>
	The new version of node supports a new type for adding to collections: NODE_REF.  This indicates that the
	node library should not make a copy, but instead add the node argument directly to the collection.  So we can 
	rewrite our code like this:
	<pre>
	pnBody = node_hash_alloc();
	pnRecords = node_list_alloc();

	for( /* all records */ )
		node_list_add( pnRecords, NODE_REF, parse_record() );

	node_hash_add( pnBody, "Records", NODE_REF, pnRecords );</pre>
	<p>
	The new code is shorter, simpler, and faster.  What's the catch?  It's also more dangerous.  When every node
	was copied before being added to a collection, it was impossible to create a circular node data structure.
	With NODE_REF, it is.  With copying, it's not possible to damage a collection by adding one of its members 
	to a different collection.  With NODE_REF, it is (although there are automated checks which should catch this error.)
	<p>
	Furthermore, with NODE_REF, the old reference to the node that is added should be treated 
	as though node_free() had been called on it.  It would be safest to set it to NULL or to the
	return value of node_hash_add() than to leave it pointing to the old node storage.  The node
	implementation <b>does not guarantee</b> that the node passed in with a NODE_REF argument will
	remain live, merely that the contents of that node (and not a copy) will be stored in the collection.
	<p>
	Another API change is that collection adding functions return a reference to the added item.
	With this and NODE_REF, we can shorted the common idiom for creating an empty list at a particular 
	place in a hash from:
	<pre>
	/* check if the list existed already */
	pnList = node_hash_get( m_pnHash, psKey );
	if( pnList == NULL )
	{
		/* create the list */
		pnList = node_list_alloc();
		node_hash_add( m_pnHash, psKey, NODE_NODE, pnList );
		node_free( pnList );
		pnList = node_hash_get( m_pnHash, psKey );
	}
	/* now pnList is a reference to the list in the hash */</pre>
	to the more streamlined version:
	<pre>
	/* check if the list existed already */
	pnList = node_hash_get( m_pnHash, psKey );
	if( pnList == NULL )
	{
		/* create the list */
		pnList = node_hash_add( m_pnHash, psKey, NODE_REF, node_list_alloc() );
	}
	/* now pnList is a reference to the list in the hash */</pre>
	which (as a bonus) avoids a copy.

	<h3> <a name="debug">Debugging Features</a> </h3>
	<p>
	There are three optional debugging features: NODE_DEBUG_INTERN, NODE_DEBUG_UNICODE, and NODE_DEBUG_REF.
	All are enabled by default in Debug builds of the node library and are disabled by default in Release builds.
	You can control these features with the api function <tt>node_set_debug( int nDebugMode )</tt>, or query the
	state of the debugging features with <tt>node_get_debug()</tt>.  Debugging features are not thread-local; they are 
	enabled or disabled for the whole process.
	<p>
	NODE_DEBUG_INTERN turns on extra debugging checks for the intern table, a non-user-visible "optimization" 
	which is currently disabled.
	<p>
	NODE_DEBUG_REF turns on extra checking when <tt>node_list_add()</tt>, <tt>node_hash_add()</tt>, or <tt>node_push()</tt>
	is called with the new NODE_REF type.  This is an attempt to guard against the creation of double-owned storage 
	or circular lists.  The following checks are made:
	<ul>
	<li> when freeing a node, the node must not be in any collection (list or hash)
	<li> when adding a node to a collection with NODE_REF, the node is not currently in any collection
	</ul>
	This guards against most NODE_REF problems:
	<pre>
	node_t * pnHash = node_hash_alloc();
	node_t * pn = node_alloc();
	node_set( pn, NODE_INT, 1 );
	node_hash_add( pnHash, "Test1", NODE_REF, pn ); /* OK */
	node_free( pn );	/* error caught by NODE_DEBUG_REF - pn was added to hash */
	node_hash_add( pnHash, "Test2", NODE_REF, pn ); /* Error caught by NODE_DEBUG_REF - pn is already in a collection */

	/* circular inclusion */
	node_hash_add( pnHash, "Test3", NODE_REF, pnHash ); /* Error not caught by NODE_DEBUG_REF */
	node_free( pnHash ); /* causes a crash */</pre>
	<p>
	NODE_DEBUG_UNICODE turns on extra string checking.  When NODE_DEBUG_UNICODE is set, strings that are passed
	through varargs (i.e., after NODE_STRINGA or NODE_STRINGW in node_set() or node_hash_add(), etc.) are checked using the Windows API call IsTextUnicode
	to assure that the string has the correct type.  The test is not perfect - in particular, it is hard to tell
	the difference between a single-character ASCII string and a Unicode string when the ASCII string happens to
	be followed by the right kind of garbage: <tt>A\0B\0\0\0</tt> is either a valid representation of the ASCII string "A" followed
	by garbage, or else a valid representation of the Unicode string "AB".
	<p>
	There is one more debugging flag which is turned on by default in debug builds - NODE_DEBUG_HASHPERF.  In
	order to use this feature, you need to call the debug version of the hash allocation functions --
	node_hash_alloc_d and node_hash_alloc2_d.  This can be accomplished for your whole project by #including node.h
	in a central place and following it with a #define block:
	<pre>
	#include "node.h"
	#ifdef _DEBUG
	#define node_hash_alloc()      node_hash_alloc_d()
	#define node_hash_alloc2(n)    node_hash_alloc2_d(n)
	#endif</pre>
	<p>
	NODE_DEBUG_HASHPERF triggers checking of hash load factors (number of entries per number of buckets) and warns
	when the hash is freed if the load factor exceeds a limit (default 10.0).  The warning is written as a debug string
	right to the Visual Studio debug messages window, and formatted such that you can use the usual Visual Studio
	go-to-error method to find the line of code which allocated the hash.  This feature is intended to help find
	spots where node_hash_alloc() is being used to create a hash into which thousands of elements are then put -- 
	a larger number of buckets is really necessary, and node_hash_alloc2() should be used instead.

	<h3> <a name="performance">Various non-user-visible performance changes</a> </h3>

	<ul>
	<li><b> Interning of node names </b><br/>
	This is currently DISABLED in node-work because it was actually making things slower.  The interning
	code ensured that only one copy of each name was currently used - maintining reference counts to
	names used multiple times - and used 'soft' interning for searching.  The idea was to make hash
	lookups faster by being able to compare pointers for equality instead of having to call stricmp().

	<li><b> Separate allocator </b><br/>
	The node library uses a separate allocator -- a version of dlmalloc -- instead of using the OS's
	heap.  This is slightly faster.  The separate allocator is only used for retail ('Release') builds,
	so that the CRT debugging allocator can be used for leak-tracking in debug builds.

	<li><b> Free list </b><br/>
	In release builds, the node library keeps a list of free'd nodes and re-uses them instead of going
	back and forth to the allocator.

	<li><b> Sequentially-allocated nodes </b><br/>
	In release builds, the node library allocates a large block (65536 bytes worth) of memory and chops it
	into 36-byte (or 68-byte when bags are turned on) node records and pre-loads the freelist with them.  This helps nodes that are allocated
	near in time to be nearby in memory, possibly improving cache locality.  It also avoids allocator overhead
	for a frequently-allocated known record size.

	<li><b> Bags </b><br/>
	

	<li><b> Internal Function Calls </b><br/>

	</ul>
